-- SCRIPT PURPOSE & USAGE
-- =====================================================================================
-- üìå PURPOSE:
-- This script creates core views in the Gold Layer of the Data Warehouse.
-- These views convert Silver Layer data into analytics-ready dimensions and facts.
--
-- üß† USAGE:
-- - Execute in SQL Server to materialize business-level datasets.
-- - Automatically handles existing views with safe DROP operations.
-- - Applies data quality checks and filters for reliable reporting.
--
-- üéØ TABLES CREATED:
-- 1. gold.dim_customers
-- 2. gold.dim_products
-- 3. gold.fact_sales
--
-- =====================================================================================
-- ‚úÖ DATA QUALITY, CONSISTENCY & STANDARDIZATION CHECKS
-- =====================================================================================
-- üîç dim_customers
-- - Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to generate a consistent surrogate key (customer_key).
-- - Gender fallback logic: If CRM gender is 'N/A', fallback to ERP's gender field.
-- - LEFT JOINs used to preserve all CRM records even if ERP values are missing.
--
-- üîç dim_products
-- - `prd_end_dt IS NULL` filters out inactive/historical products to ensure only current data is exposed.
-- - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` for surrogate key generation based on product start date and key.
-- - Joins category and subcategory details from reference table with `LEFT JOIN`.
--
-- üîç fact_sales
-- - Foreign keys (`product_key`, `customer_key`) ensured via JOINs with Gold Dimensions.
-- - LEFT JOINs used so that missing references don‚Äôt exclude valid sales records.
-- - Price, quantity, and sales_amount directly mapped from transactional Silver data.
--
-- All views are business-trusted and model-ready for BI tools, dashboards, or advanced analytics.
